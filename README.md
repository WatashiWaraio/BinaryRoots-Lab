# BinaryRoots-Lab 🌱 🌿 🌲

Hi everyone! 🌟 Today, Miguel and I are excited to present our project an application developed in Java  to undestand the concepts of binary trees and see how code works! 🌱✨

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and understanding them is crucial for anyone looking to delve into algorithms and data management. 
This application consists of three distinct modules focusing on different types of binary trees: common binary trees, binary search trees, and Huffman trees. With this application, users can explore all these fascinating concepts interactively.

## What is a Binary Tree? 🤔

A binary tree is a non-linear data structure used in computer science to organize and store data efficiently. It consists of nodes, where each node can have up to two children, known as left and right children. 🌿

Binary trees can be used in many applications, including:

- Compression Algorithms
- Hierarchical Data Representation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Database Indexing
- Networking Protocols

## Features of Our App: 🌟

With this app, you can learn how binary trees work by creating three types of trees:

- Common Binary Trees 🌳
- Binary Search Trees 🔍
- Huffman Trees 📊
  
You will also be able to:

- Perform In-Order, Pre-Order, and Post-Order traversals, allowing you to see the different ways of navigating through the tree. 🔄
- View the height and level of the tree, giving you insights into its structure. 📏
- Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on the tree, allowing you to explore nodes level by level. 🌐

## Understanding Nodes: 🗂️🌼

Within a binary tree, we have fundamental structures called nodes. Here are some key types of nodes:

- Root Node 🌳: The topmost node in the tree, from which all other nodes descend.
- Leaf Node 🍂: A node that does not have any children; it’s at the end of a branch.
- Branch Node 🌿: A node that has at least one child and connects two or more nodes.
  
## MVC Architecture: 🏗️🌳
This application is designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, making it easier to understand and practice the concepts of binary trees. This separation of concerns allows for cleaner code and a more organized way to manage the application. 🌼

We hope this application enhances your understanding of binary trees. 🌱🌞

Bye we hope you'll understand this app. 😊
